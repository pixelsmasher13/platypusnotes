## Voice Transcription

Two modes, controlled via a toggle in Settings (or during onboarding):

| | OpenAI API (default) | Local Whisper |
|---|---|---|
| **How it works** | Records WAV, uploads to OpenAI Whisper API | On-device transcription via whisper.cpp |
| **Model** | OpenAI Whisper | User-selectable (see below) |
| **Requires** | OpenAI API key | Nothing (model auto-downloaded on first use) |
| **Real-time** | No (transcribes after recording) | Yes (live transcript streams during recording) |
| **Offline** | No | Yes |
| **Hardware accel** | N/A | Metal (macOS), CPU fallback |

**Local models** (selectable in Settings): Distil Large v3.5 (~1.5GB, default), Large v3 Turbo (~1.6GB), Large v3 (~3.1GB, best quality).
